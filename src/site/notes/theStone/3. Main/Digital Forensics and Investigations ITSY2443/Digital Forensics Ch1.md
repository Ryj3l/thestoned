## üìù Notes
- **Digital Forensics** is the application of computer science and investigative procedures for a legal purpose involving the analysis of digital evidence after the proper **search authority**, **chain of custody**, **validation with mathematics**, **use of validated tools**, **repeatability**, **reporting**, and possible **expert presentation**.
- **ISO 27037 Information technology - Security Techniques** ( a standard for digital forensics) was ratified in October 2012.
- The **Federal Rules of Evidencee (FRE)** was signed into law in **1973** and created to ensure consistency in federal proceedings. Many states' rulse map to the **FRE**
- **FBI Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART)** was formed in 1984 to handle cases involving digital evidence.
- In the late **1990s**, **CART** teamed up with the **Department of Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL)**.
- The **4th Amendment** to U.S Constitution protects everyone's right to be secure from search and seizure. Separate search warrants might not be necessary for digital evidence.
- Every U.S jurisdiction has case law related to the admissibility of evidence recovered from computers and other digital devices.
- Investigating digital devices includes:
	- Collecting data securely
	- Examining suspect data to determine details such as origin and content
	- Presenting digital information to courts
	- Applying laws to digital device practices
- **Digital Forensics** is different from **data recovery**. **Data recovery** involves the retrieving of information that was deleted by mistake or lost during a power surge or crash event.
- **Forensics Investigators** often work as part of a team, known as the investigations triad.

- **Vulnerability/threat assessment & risk management** tests & verifies the integrity of stand-along workstations & networked servers.
- **Network Intrusion Detection & Incident Response** detects intruder attacks by using automated tools & monitoring network firewall logs.
- **Digital Investigations** manage investigations & conducts forensics analysis of systems suspected of containing evidence.
- By the early 1990s the **International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS)** introduced training on software for digital forensics.
- **IRS** created search warrant programs
- **ASR Data** created Expert Witness for Mac
- **Ilook** is currently maintained by the **IRS Criminal Investigation Division**
- **AccessData Forensic Toolkit (FTK)** is a popular commercial product

### Understanding Case Law###
- Existing laws can't keeper with the rate of technological change
- When statutes don't exist, case law is used. This allows legal counsel to apply previous similar cases to current ones in an effort to address ambiguity in laws.
- Examiners must be familiar with recent court rulings on search and seizure in the electronic environment.
### Developing Digital Forensics Resources###
- To supplement your knowledge you should develop and maintain contacts with computing, networking & investigative professionals.
- Join computer user groups in both the public & private sector. EX: **Computer Technology Investigators Network (CTIN)** is a group that meets to discuss problems digital forensics examiners encounter.
- Consult outside experts
### Preparing for Digital Investigations**
- Digital investigations fall into two categories:
	- Public sector investigations
	- Private sector investigations
![Pasted image 20240821184611.png](/img/user/theStone/4.%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020240821184611.png)
- Public sector investigations involve government agencies responsible for criminal investigations and prosecution. The **4th** amendment of the U.S Constitution restrict government search and seizure.
- The **Deparment of Justice (DOJ)** updates information on computer search and seizure regularly
- Private sector investigations focus more on policy violations
### Understanding Law Enforcement Agency Investigations###
- When conducting Public sector investigations, you must understand laws on computer related crimes including:
	- Standard legal processes
	- Guidelines on search & seizure
	- How to build a criminal case
- **The computer Fraud and Abuse Act** was passed in 1986; specific state laws were generally developed later.
### Following Legal Processes###
- A criminal investigation usually begins when someone finds evidence of or witnesses a crime. The witness or victim makes an **allegation** to the police
- The police interview the complainant & writes a report about the crime
- The report is processed & management decides to start an investigation or log the information in a police blotter. **Blotter** is a historical database of previous crimes
- **Digital Evidence First Responder (DEFR)** arrives on an incident scene, assesses the situation & takes precautions to acquire & preserve evidence.
- **Digital Evidence Specialist (DES)** has the skill to analyze the data & determine when another specialist should be called in to assist.
- **Affidavit** is a sworn statement of support of facts about or evidence of a crime; it must include **exhibits** that support the allegation.
### Understanding Private Sector Investigations ###
- Private sector investigations involve private companies & lawtyers who address company policy violations & litigation disputes; EX: wrongful termination
- Businesses strive to minimize or eliminate litigation
- Private sector crimes can involve:
	- Email harassment, falsification of data, gender & age discrimination, embezzlement, sabotage, & industrial espionage
- Businesses can reduce the rsitk of litigation by publishing & maintaining policies that employees find easy to read & follow
- Most important policies define rules for using the company's computers & networks; usually known as an "Acceptable use Policy"
- **Line of Authority** states who has the legal right to initiate an investigation, who can take possession of evidence & who can have access to evidence.
- Business can avoid litigation by displaying a **warning banner** on computer screens. This informs end users that the organization reserves the right to inspect computer systems and network traffic at will.
![Pasted image 20240821191805.png](/img/user/theStone/4.%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020240821191805.png)
- Sample text that can be used in internal warning banners include:
	- Use of this system & network is for official business only
	- Systems & Networks are subject to monitoring at any time by the owner
	- Using this system implies consent to monitoring by the owner
	- Unauthorized or illegal users of this system or network will be subject to discipline or prosecution
- Businesses are advised to specify an **authorized requester** who has the power to initiate investigations.
- Examples of groups with authority:
	- Corporate Security Investigations
	- Corporate Ethics Office
	- Corporate equal employment opportunity office
	- Internal Auditing
	- The general counsel or legal department
- During private investigations, you search for evidence to support allegations of violations of a company's rules or an attack on its assets.
- 3 types of common situations are:
	- Abuse of misuse of computing assets
	- E-mail abuse
	- Internet Abuse
- A private sector investigator's job is to minimize risk to the company
- The distinction between personal & company computer property can be difficult with cell/smart phones, personal notebooks, tablets & computers.
- **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** environments are tough to navigate and some companies state that if you connect a personal device to the business network, it falls under the same rules as company property.
### Maintaining Professional Conduct ###
- **Professional Conduct** includes ethics, morals, & standards of behavior.
- An investigator must exhibit the highest level of professional behavior at all times
	- Maintain Objectivity
	- Maintain credibility by maintaining confidentiality
- Investigators should also attend training to stay current with the latest technical changes in computer hardware & software, networking, & forensic tools
### Preparing a Digital Forensics Investigation ###
- The role of digital forensics professionals is to gather evidence to prove that a suspect committed a crime or violated a company policy
- Collect evidence that can be offered in court or at a corporate inquiry:
	- Investigate the suspect's computer
	- Preserve the evidence on a different computer
- **Chain of custody** is the route the evidence takes from the time you find it until the case is closed or goes to court
### Overview of a Computer Crime ###
- Computers can contain information that helps law enforcement determine:
	- Chain of events leading to a crime
	- Evidence that can lead to a conviction
- Law enforcement officers should follow proper procedure when acquiring the evidence as digital evidence can be easily altered by an overeager investigator.
- A challenge that is occasionally faced is information on hard disks might be encrypted so forensics tools may need to be used in your investigation.
### An overview of a Company Policy Violation ###
- Employees misusing resources can cost companies millions of dollars
- Misuse includes:
	- Surfing the internet
	- Sending personal emails
	- Using company computers for personal tasks
### Taking a Systematic Approach ###
- Steps for problem solving:
	- Make an initital assessment about the type of case you are investigating
	- Determine a preliminary design or approach to the case
	- Create a detailed checklist
	- Determine the resources you need
	- Obtain and copy an evidence drive
	- Identify the risks
	- Mitigate or minimize the risks
	- Test the design
	- Analyze & recover the digital evidence
	- Investigate the data your recover
	- Complete the case report
	- Critique the case
### Assessing the Case ###
- Systematically outline the case details:
	- Situation
	- Nature of the case
	- Specifics of the case
	- Type of evidence
	- Known disk format
	- Location of evidence
- Based on these details you can determine the case requirements

### Planning Your Investigation ###
- A basic investigation plan should include the following activities:
	- Acquire the evidence
	- Complete an evidence form & establish a chain of custody
	- Transport the evidence to a computer forensics lab
	- Secure evidence in an **approved secure container**
	- Prepare your **forensics workstation**
	- Retrieve the evidence from the secure container
	- Make a forensic copy of the evidence
	- Return the evidence to the secure container
	- Process the copied evidence with computer forensics tools
- An **evidence custody form** helps you document what has been done with the original evidence & its forensics copies; also called a chain of evidence form
- There are 2 types of chain of evidence forms:
	- **Single-evidence form** - Lists each piece of evidence on a separate page
	- **Multi-evidence form**

![Pasted image 20240821200527.png](/img/user/theStone/4.%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020240821200527.png)
### Securing Your Evidence ###
- Use evidence bags to secure & catalog the evidence
- Use computer safe products when collecting computer evidence:
	- Antistatic bags
	- Antistatic pads
- Use well padded containers
- Use evidence tape to seal all openings:
	- Cd Drive bays
	- Insertion slots for power supply electrical cords & USB cables
- Write your initials on tape to prove that evidence has not been tampered with
- Consider computer specific temperature & humidity ranges; make sure you have a safe environment for transporting & storing it until a secure evidence container is available.
### Procedures for Private Sector High-Tech Investigations ###
- As an investigator, you need to develop formal procedures & informal checklists; to cover all issues important to high-tech investigations & ensure that correct techniques are used in investigations.
### Employees Termination Cases ###
- The majority of investigative work for termination cases involves employee abuse of corporate assets.
- Incidents that create a hostile work environment are the predominant types of cases investigated. These include things such as viewing pornography in the workplace & sending inappropriate emails.
- Organizations must have appropriate polices in place
### Internet Abuse Investigation ###
- To conduct an investigation you need:
	- Organization's Internet proxy logs
	- Suspect computer's IP address
	- Suspect computer's disk drive
	- Your preferred computer forensics analysis tool
- Recommended steps:
	- Use standard forensic analysis techniques & procedures

	- For Web based email investigations, use tools such as FTK's Internet Keyword Search option to extract all related email address information
	- Examine header data of all messages of interest to the investigation
### Attorney-Client Privilege Investigations ###
- Under **attorney-client privilege (ACP)** rules for an attorney; you must keep all findings confidential.
- Many attorneys like to have printouts of the data you have recovered; you need to persuade & educate many attorneys on how digital evidence can be viewed electronically.
- You can also encounter problems if you find data in the form of binary files
- Steps for conducting an ACP case:
	- Request a memorandum from the attorney directing you to start the investigation
	- Request a list of keywords of interest to the investigation
	- Initiate the investigation & analysis
	- For disk drive examinations, make 2 bit-stream images using different tools for each image.
	- Compare hash signatures on all files on the original & re-created disks
	- Methodically examine every portion of the disk drive & extract all data
	- Run keyword searches on allocated and unallocated disk space
	- For Windows OSs, use specialty tools to analyze & extract data from the Registry
	- For binary data files such as CAD drawings, locate the correct software product
	- For unallocated data recovery, use a tool that removes or replaces nonprintable data
	- Consolidate all recovered data from the evidence bit-stream image into folders & subfolders
- Other Guidelines:
	- Minimize written communications with the attorney
	- Any documentation written to the attorney must contain a header stating that it's "Privileged Legal Communication - Confidential Work Product"
	- Assist the attorney & paralegal in analyzing data

	- Discreetly gather any additional evidence
	- Collect all log data from networks and email servers
	- Report regularly to management & corporate attorneys
	- Review the investigation's scope with management a* corporate attorneys

### Interviews and Interrogations in High-Tech Investigations###
- Becoming a skilled interviewer & interrogator can take many years of experience
- Interviews are usually conducted to collect information from a witness or suspect about specific facts related to an investigation.
- **Interrogation** is the process of trying to get a suspect to confess
- The role of a **Digital Investigator** is to instruct the investigator conducting the interview on what questions to ask & what the answers should be
- Ingredients for a successful interview or interrogation
	- Being patient throughout the session
	- Repeating or rephrasing questions to zero in on specific facts from a reluctant witness or suspect
	- Being tenacious
### Understanding Data Recovery Workstations and Software ###
- Investigations are conducted on a computer forensics lab (data-recovery lab)
	- In data recovery, the customer or your company just wants the data back
- Computer forensics workstation
	- A specially configured PC loaded with additional bays and forensics software
- To avoid altering the evidence use:
	- Write-blockers devices; these enable you to boot to Windows without writing data to the evidence drive
### Setting Up Your Workstation for Digital Forensic ###
- Basic Requirements:
	- A workstation running Windows 7 or later
	- A write-blocker device
	- Digital forensics acquisition tool
	- Digital forensics analysis tool
	- Target drive to receive the source or suspect disk data
	- Spare PATA or SATA ports
	- USB ports
- Additional Useful Items
	- Network Interface Card (NIC)
	- Extra USB ports
	- FireWire 400/800 ports
	- SCSI card
	- Disk editor tool
	- Text editor tool
	- Graphics viewer program
	- Other specialized viewing tools
### Conducting an Investigation ###
- Gather resources identified in investigation plan
- Items Needed
	- Original storage media
	- Evidence custody form
	- Evidence container for the storage media
	- Bit-stream imaging tool
	- Forensic workstation to copy & examine your evidence
	- Securable evidence locker, cabinet or safe
### Gathering the Evidence ###
- Avoid damaging the evidence
- **Steps:**
	- Meet the IT manager to interview them
	- Fill out the evidence form, have the IT manager sign
	- Place the evidence in a secure container
	- Carry the evidence to the computer forensics lab
	- Complete the evidence custody form
	- Secure evidence by locking the container
### Understanding Bit-Stream Copies ###
- **Bit-stream copy** can be described as follows:
	- Bit-by-bit copy of the original storage medium]
	- Exact copy of the original disk
	- Different from a simple backup copy; backup software can only copy known files. Backup software cannot copy deleted files, email messages or recover file fragments
- **Bit-stream image** is a file containing the bit-stream copy of all data on a disk or partition; also known as an "image" or "image file"
- Copy image file to a target disk that matches the original disk's manufacturer, size & model

### Acquiring an Image of Evidence Media###
- The **FIRST** rule of computer forensics is to the preserve the original evidence
- Conduct your analysis only on a copy of the data
- Several vendors provide MS-DOS, Linux & Windows acquisition tools; Windows tools require a write-blocking device when acquiring data from FAT or NTFS file systems.
### Analyzing Your Digital Evidence ###
- Your job is to recover data from:
	- Deleted files
	- File fragments
	- Complete Files
- Deleted files linger on the disk until new data is saved on the same physical location
- Tool can be used to retrieve deleted files
	- Autopsy
